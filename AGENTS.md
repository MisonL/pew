## Scope and instruction sources

- This file applies throughout the repository.
- `packages/web/AGENTS.md` and `packages/web/CLAUDE.md` are Next.js-generated adapters. Follow their framework guidance for web changes; do not recreate root legacy compatibility in them.
- Maintain this file as the only root handbook; do not recreate `CLAUDE.md`, a symlink, an import or a compatibility alias.
- Source of truth: root and `packages/*/package.json`, `vitest.config.ts` and `vitest.e2e-cli.config.ts`, `biome.json`, composite `tsconfig` references, `.husky/`, `scripts/`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and the quality-system docs ([upgrade](docs/30-quality-system-upgrade.md), [D1 isolation](docs/31-d1-test-isolation.md)). Record drift rather than lowering the contract.

## Setup and commands

Run from the repository root with Bun as package manager and runtime.

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
bun run dev
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun run test
bun run test:coverage
bun run test:e2e
bun run test:e2e:cli
bun run test:e2e:ui
bun run test:security
bun run sync-prices
bun run release
```

`build` builds core types then web; the CLI must be built explicitly with `bun run --cwd packages/cli build` before publishing. `lint` chains typecheck, Biome `--error-on-warnings`, and the two AST gates (`scripts/check-dynamic-delete.ts`, `scripts/check-ts-expect-error.ts`, both on oxc-parser, decoupled from the tsc version). Ports: dev=7020, API E2E=17020, BDD E2E=27020.

E2E uses per-run temporary local D1/KV bindings and source Workers, never remote test resources. Run from a clean task clone without `.env*` files (except examples); the runners fail closed instead of reading daily-development secrets. Build `@pew/core` first. Each run verifies both `_test_marker` environment and random ownership ID, uses a test-only loopback Cloudflare-envelope bridge, and cleans owned processes/state in `finally`. Port conflicts fail without killing another process. CI must not materialize cloud credentials for these tests.

## Source scanning principles

Three inviolable rules govern how pew interacts with source data:

1. **Raw data is read-only**: never modify, delete or move original AI-tool log files. Write operations are limited to pew's own state files under `~/.config/pew/`.
2. **Source isolation**: each source is completely independent. Even a buggy parser must never corrupt or affect data from other sources.
3. **Idempotent uploads**: `pew reset && pew sync` is always safe. Duplicate uploads deduplicate via `ON CONFLICT` upserts, never summed; the same raw data always produces the same final state.

## Conventions

- TypeScript strict mode with composite project references across all five packages.
- TDD: write tests first, then implement. Conventional Commits, atomic, one logical change per commit.
- `@pew/core` is not published: pure types, `import type` only, `devDependencies`.
- Preserve incremental rewind/cursor-loss recovery and source-specific token accounting; raw conversation bodies are not uploaded. Keep raw logs and real CLI state out of fixtures.
- Preserve Google login, invitation/device flows, bearer handling and authorized data/query access. Keep secrets server-side, routes thin and MVVM boundaries intact. All web reads use typed `DbRead` RPC methods; the read Worker owns SQL and accepts parameters only through `/api/rpc`. Do not restore a generic SQL endpoint.
- Preserve standalone assets/SWC helper packaging and pin Bun across local/CI/container versions.
- Tests must not use `.skip`/`.only`; Biome elevates `noSkippedTests`/`noFocusedTests` to errors in the test-file override.

### DateTime strategy

All date/time values follow a strict UTC-in, local-out pattern:

- **Storage (D1 SQLite)**: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `hour_start` use `datetime('now')` (UTC). Season `start_date`/`end_date` are ISO 8601 UTC strings (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`), precision to minute; status is derived at read time via `deriveSeasonStatus()`, never stored.
- **Computation (API routes, Worker, CLI)**: all date arithmetic in UTC (`toISOString()`, `Date.UTC()`, `getUTC*()`); never `setDate()`/`getDate()` server-side — use `setUTCDate()`/`getUTCDate()`.
- **Display (Web UI)**: convert to the user's local timezone before rendering; `tzOffset` pattern for bucketing; `toLocaleString()`/`toLocaleDateString()` on the client.
- **`datetime-local` inputs** show local wallclock time: UTC → local via `utcToLocalDatetimeValue()`, local → UTC via `localDatetimeValueToUtc()` (both in `date-helpers.ts`). Never append `Z` to a `datetime-local` value directly.
- **Ordering/equality**: always epoch ms (`new Date(x).getTime()`), never string comparison — ISO variants have unstable lexicographic order.

## CLI dev workflow and state files

Detailed state, time and release contracts: [agent operations](docs/49-agent-operations.md). CLI sync/init/reset are state-changing operations, not documentation checks. Use synthetic sources and temporary directories for CLI tests (`bun run test:e2e:cli`).

```sh
bun run build
bun run --cwd packages/cli build
bun run --filter '@pew/web' dev
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 bun packages/cli/dist/bin.js sync --dev
```

A full reset removes `~/.config/pew/cursors.json`, `queue.jsonl` and `queue.state.json` before re-syncing. State files: `config.json` (prod API key `pk_...`), `config.dev.json` (dev API key), `cursors.json` (per-file byte offsets + directory mtimes, shared across dev/prod), `queue.jsonl` (pending upload records), `queue.state.json` (queue metadata).

## Testing and quality contract

Run the checks relevant to the change; hook and CI requirements still apply. Statuses: `enforced`, `planned`, `manual`, `N/A`.

| Dimension | Required contract | Current status and evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L1 — pre-commit quality | UT with all four coverage metrics ≥95%; strict types and check-only lint with zero errors/warnings; installed hooks on the index snapshot; proven rejection; under 30s; no skipped/focused tests. Pure Views may be covered by L3; business logic stays in scope. | planned, with the core subchecks implemented. `.husky/pre-commit` materializes the staged tree with `checkout-index` into a temp snapshot, verifies staged manifests match the installed worktree, dry-run-checks the frozen lockfile, regenerates staged prerequisites (`@pew/core` build, `next typegen`), reuses worktree `node_modules` read-only, and runs `vitest run --coverage`, `scripts/parallel-typecheck.sh` (five packages, strict tsc), Biome `--error-on-warnings` and both AST gates there; every commit runs the full gate with no caches and exit-code rejection. `vitest.config.ts` enforces 95/95/95/95 (v8) with documented by-design exclusions (presentation `.tsx`, `use-*` hooks, CLI command entry points covered by CLI E2E, framework adapters, pure type modules). The <30s budget is unmeasured, so full unified L1 (including the static lanes, former G1) remains planned rather than certified. |
| L2 — integration | Real HTTP against the actual application; complete endpoint/method coverage | enforced for the existing 99 API cases, including all-time device totals/details/timeline and exact status assertions. `scripts/run-e2e.ts` runs the actual local Next server on `127.0.0.1:17020` backed by per-run real D1/KV and source Workers. Exhaustive endpoint/method inventory is not certified. |
| L3 — system | Critical user journeys on isolated resources | enforced for the existing 91 Playwright cases. Page readiness maps all 29 pages to populated real-API/module checks or explicit redirects; L1 rejects missing page inventory entries and typechecks browser tests. Responsive trend layout and agent visualizations use real data; intentional visual/failure mocks remain separate. `scripts/run-e2e-ui.ts` uses `:27020` and its own temporary seeded D1/KV/Worker target, separate from the API lane. |
| G2 — security | Dependency and secret scans; missing required scanner fails | enforced. `scripts/run-security.ts` is the single entry point (osv-scanner + gitleaks) and runs in pre-push; CI quality uses the tracked `osv-scanner.toml`. |
| D1 — test isolation | Test state physically separate from production and daily development; guards before destructive fixture operations | enforced by the local runner: no environment files, synthetic credentials, test-only loopback endpoint, actual SQL environment/run markers, native migrations and per-run cleanup. Guard/schema/failure/signal regressions run in the normal test gate and strict harness typecheck. See [local E2E isolation](docs/32-local-e2e-isolation.md). |

Current hooks: pre-commit runs the full local index-snapshot L1 gate; pre-push runs isolated L2 E2E, L3 BDD and G2 in parallel and rejects local environment files. CI mirrors quality, L2 and L3 without cloud-secret injection. Tag pushes also invoke Git pre-push hooks; never bypass them. Targets remain unified L1 under 30s and pre-push L2/G2 under three minutes on stdin pushed refs; timing is not certified and ref-reading is not implemented.

The owner merged former G1 into L1 on 2026-09-21; the framework keeps the 6DQ name. Use `system0-6dq-l1` for the L1 contract and its S/A/B/F rubric.

## Operations and release

npm publication of `@nocoo/pew` follows the full procedure; it is an authorized operation, not a per-edit step:

1. `bun run release` (or `-- minor|major|x.y.z`): bumps versions across files, syncs the lockfile, generates the changelog, verifies no stale versions, commits. Push/tag/GitHub-release are interactive; pre-push runs the isolated L2/L3/G2 gates without cloud credentials.
2. Build both: `bun install && bun run build && bun run --cwd packages/cli build` — root `build` builds core + web only.
3. `bun run test`.
4. Verify the dist version (`packages/cli/package.json` is authoritative; the CLI reads its version at runtime via `readVersion()`).
5. `cd packages/cli && npm publish --dry-run`.
6. `npm publish` (OTP via `--otp=<code>` or browser auth when prompted).
7. Verify with `npx @nocoo/pew@latest --help`.
8. Watch CI: after push, check `gh run list --limit 5` within a few minutes; local pre-push does not catch every failure mode (workspace links, deploy pipeline).

Web deploys go through `git push` (Railway auto-deploy); never `railway up`, which bypasses the git-based gates. Any Worker code or schema change requires `wrangler deploy` plus a real verification request before the feature counts as complete. See [Retrospective.md](Retrospective.md) for the shipped-bug narratives behind these rules.

## Ponytail audit

For `ponytail-audit`, read `.agents/skills/ponytail-audit/SKILL.md`. Its pew-specific scope extends the global complexity audit to parser → cursor → spool → upload → Worker UPSERT → API/UI correctness, privacy, timestamps and compatibility. Run `sh scripts/ponytail-audit.sh` for deterministic JSON on stdout; the audit must not write reports or touch real logs, state, queues or services. Full tests and independent reviews stay separate from this read-only audit.

## Retrospective

Accident narratives live in [Retrospective.md](Retrospective.md). Keep only concise recurring project rules here; cross-project lessons go to global rules/nmem, deterministic checks to hooks/tests.
