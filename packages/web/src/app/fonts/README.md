# Bundled font assets

These unchanged Latin WOFF2 assets preserve the existing Inter, Space Grotesk and Caveat typography. `next/font/local` avoids the Next 16.3.6 Turbopack Google-font resolver failure during builds. No Fontsource runtime dependency is installed. Inter uses weights 100–900, Space Grotesk 400–700 and Caveat 700; each variable file contains the upstream weight axis, with only the existing weights declared by the app.
